*Rulemaking Authority 633.104, 633.206 FS. Law Implemented 429.11, 633.206 FS. History–New 11-29-89, Amended 1-7-97, Formerly 4A-40.022.*

**69A-40.023 Purpose.**

The purpose of this rule chapter is to establish uniform requirements to provide a reasonable degree of safety from fire in buildings and structures used as assisted living facilities. These rules try to avoid requirements which might result in unreasonable hardship, or unnecessary inconvenience or interference with the normal use and occupancy of a building, but at the same time insist upon compliance with uniform standards for firesafety consistent with the public interest, even though a financial hardship may result in some individual cases.

*Rulemaking Authority 633.104, 633.206 FS. Law Implemented 429.11, 633.206 FS. History–New 11-29-89, Amended 1-7-97, Formerly 4A-40.023.*

**69A-40.024 Scope.**

(1) This rule chapter applies to any institution, building, or buildings, residence, private home, boarding home, home for the aged, or any other place, whether operated for profit or not, which is an assisted living facility under the definitions of Chapter 429, F.S., and of Rule Chapter 59A-36, F.A.C.

(2) This rule chapter is concerned with life safety during fires and similar emergencies. This rule chapter addresses particular matters of construction, protection and occupancy of buildings to try to minimize danger to life from fire, smoke, fumes, or panic before buildings are vacated.

(1) “Administrator” shall mean an individual meeting the definition in Section 429.02(2), F.S.

(2) “Assisted Living Facility” (ALF) shall be as defined in Section 429.02(5), F.S. The definition does not apply to transient rentals as defined in Section 509.013(11), F.S. For firesafety purposes, the size of the ALF is determined by the license as issued by the Agency for Health Care Administration.

(3) “Authority having jurisdiction” (AHJ) shall mean the governmental entity, organization, office, or individual responsible by law or ordinance to conduct and enforce uniform firesafety requirements in accordance with Section 633.206(2)(b), F.S.

(4) “Final Administrative Interpreting Authority” shall mean the State Fire Marshal.

(5) “Legacy facility” shall mean any ALF that has elected to comply with the option afforded in Section 429.41(1)(a)2.d., F.S.

(6) “NFPA” means the National Fire Protection Association.

(7) “Owner” shall refer to the person, partnership, association, or corporation that owns the assisted living facilities enterprise, whether licensed or not. In the event an ALF is operated by a person that leases the physical plant which is owned by another person, “owner” means the person that operates the ALF. When the person that owns the physical plant is an affiliate of the person that operates the ALF and has significant control over the day-to-day operation for the ALF, he or she is considered an owner of the ALF.

**69A-40.028 Standards of the National Fire Protection Association Adopted.**

Unless the ALF is a legacy facility as defined in subsection 69A-40.027(5), F.A.C., the uniform firesafety standards applicable to ALFs in Florida, including other buildings or structures located on the premises of said ALFs, are the standards of the National Fire Protection Association for life safety from fire, as they relate to ALFs, in the editions of the NFPA 101, Life Safety Code<sup>®</sup>, and NFPA 101A, Guide on Alternative Approaches to Life Safety, which are incorporated by reference in Rule 69A-3.012, F.A.C.

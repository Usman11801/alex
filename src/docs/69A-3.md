(6) Notice required for structures with light-frame truss-type construction.

Purpose: The purpose of this rule is to require the placement of an identifying symbol on structures constructed with a light-frame truss component in a manner sufficient to warn persons conducting fire control and other emergency operations of the existence of light-frame truss-type construction in the structure.

(a) Definitions.

1\. “Light-frame truss-type construction” means a type of construction whose primary structural elements are formed by a system of repetitive wood or light gauge steel framing members.

2\. “Approved symbol” means a Maltese Cross measuring 8 inches horizontally and 8 inches vertically, of a bright red reflective color, designed in accordance with Figure 1.

(b) Any commercial, industrial, or any multiunit residential structure of three units or more which uses horizontal or vertical light-frame truss-type construction in any portion shall be marked with an approved symbol. Townhouses are not multiunit residential structures and therefore not subject to this rule. Each approved symbol shall include within the center circle one of the following designations:

1\. Structures with light-frame truss roofs shall be marked with the letter “R.”

2\. Structures with light-frame truss floor systems shall be marked with the letter “F.”

3\. Structures with light-frame truss floor and roof systems shall be marked with the letters “R/F.”

(c) The approved symbol shall be placed within 24 inches to the left of the main entry door and:

1\. Be permanently attached to the face of the structure on a contrasting background, or

2\. Be mounted on a contrasting base material which is then permanently attached to the face of the structure.

(d) The distance above the grade, walking surface or the finished floor to the bottom of the symbol shall be not less than 4 feet (48 inches).
